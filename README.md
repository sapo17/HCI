  This app is primarily developed on iPhone X however, the functionalities seem to work on both platforms( iOS or Android ).

  The project is also available at: https://expo.io/@sapo13/projects/mya2musicapp

  Since this is my first experience with react native, I heavily depended on the react native and react native elements documentation. This work additionally contains code similarities from various articles from:
